    <h1> 2016-2017 NBA season</h1>
                  <p> The 2016-2017 season was a historic season for the entire NBA, as it was the first season after the reitrement 
                    of Kobe Bryant. 
                    The finals was expected to be a rematch of the previous year, with the Golden State Warriors facing off 
                    against the Cleveland Cavaliers.
                    But this time, the Warriors were even more dominant, with the addition of Kevin Durant. 
                    They finished the regular season with a 67-15 record, and stormed through the west,
                    going 12-0 in the playoffs to reach the finals.</p>
                    <p> The finals was a one-sided affair, with the Warriors winning the series and Kevin Durant being named Finals MVP 
                      for his outstanding performance throughout the series.</p>

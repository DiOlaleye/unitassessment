<h1>2010-2011 NBA season</h1>
    <p>Entering the 2010-2011 season, many people expected 2 teams to dominte, the Heat, and the Lakers. 
    This was not the case, as a dark horse stole the spotlight: Derrick Rose</p>

    <h1> 2011 Playoffs</h1>
    <p> As the playoffs rolled around the focus was on 2 teams: The "Big Three" of the Miami Heat,
      and the defending champions, Kobe Bryant led Los Angeles Lakers. 
      The Heat steamrolled through the east, even knocking out the MVP Derrick Rose and the Bulls. 
      But in the West, it was a whole different story. </p>
      
    <p> The Dallas Mavericks, led by Dirk Nowitzki, shocked the world by knocking out the Lakers in 6 games in the Western Conference Finals. 
      The Mavericks would go on to face the Heat in the finals, and in a stunning upset, the Mavericks won their first championship in franchise history in 6 games. 
      Dirk Nowitzki was named Finals MVP for his outstanding performance throughout the series. Lebron had his worst series of his life, only averaging 17 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists on horrible efficiency.</p>

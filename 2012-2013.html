    <h1> 2012-2013 NBA season</h1>
    <p> The 2012-2013 season was an exciting season, but for the Los Angeles lakers, it was nothing short of dissapointing. 
        The team everyone expected to be a title contender were nothing more than a fringe afterthought. 
        To make things worse, Kobe Bryant suffered an Achillies tear, making him unavailable for the playoffs. Without him, Lakers stood no chance.</h3>
        <p> The primary focus was on 3 teams, Miami Heat, San Antonio Spurs, and Olahoma City Thunder.</p>
        <p> The NBA finals were the Miami Heat vs San Antonio Spurs. A matchup everyone anticipated saw the Heat go down 3-2, going to game 6 back in South Beach. With seconds left, the Heat were down 3. Then....</p>

        <p> The shot that sent shockwaves through the NBA world. 
          Ray Allen hitting that 3 forced overtime, where the Heat won to force a game 7 back on their home floor.
        The Miami Heat won the Game 7 with a nail-bitter, with LeBron James winning his second Finals MVP, finishing a historic season.</p>
        <p>This season also saw the emergence of Stephen Curry as a superstar, but injuries have prevented him from making a real impact.. for now</p>
        <h1> 2013 NBA OFFSEASON</h1>
        <p> The 2013 offseason saw Andre Iguondala join the Golden    
        State Warriors, a move that would pay huge dividends in the future.
        The Miami Heat also re-signed Ray Allen,
        a move that would prove to be crucial in their quest for back-to-back championships.
        But the biggest shock of the Offseason saw Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce being traded to the Brooklyn Nets, 
        which saw the Boston Celtics getting back a haul of draft picks that would be turned into their next championship [foreshadowing]</p>
        <p> But the biggest move of the offseason was the trade that sent James Harden to the Houston Rockets. 
          This move was seen as a way for the Rockets to become a title contender, and it would pay off in the future.</p>

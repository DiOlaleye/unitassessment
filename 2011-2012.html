    <h1>2011-2012 NBA season</h1>
    <p> Lebron entered this season with a chip on his shoulder. Having his worst series in the Finals, a lot of criticism was on the Heat's "Big 3.
      Lebron took that criticism and channeled it all on the court, winning his 3rd MVP award and leading the Heat to a 46-20 record in a lockout shortened season. Other notable stars this year were Kevin Durant, who won his 2nd scoring title, and Chris Paul, who led the league in assists.</p>
    <p> But of course, with greatness always comes heartbreak. Just not to LeBron.</p>

    <p>Derrick Rose tore his ACL in game 1 vs the Trailblazers. In a game where he wasn't supposed to be playing that late because it was a blowout.</p>
    <p> Due to his ACL tear, Derrick Rose and the Chicago Bulls got blown out of the water by the Miami Heat, 
      as they would storm their way through the east on their path to the NBA finals, looking for redemption. 
      There, they would have to face a young Oklahoma City Thunder team, led by Kevin Durant, Russel Westbrook, and James Harden</p>
    <p> The Thunder took the first, but they stood no chance against the 3 headed beast that was LeBron James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. Lebron James captured his first championship, as he would also go on to win the NBA Finals MVP</p>

      <p> The 2012 offseason also saw the emergence of a new star, Anthony Davis, who was drafted by the New Orleans Hornets with the first overall pick.

    <h1> 2018-2019 NBA season</h1>
                  <p> The 2018-2019 season saw the Golden State Warriors continue their dominance, finishing with a 57-25 record. 
                                    The Houston Rockets finished second in the West, with a 53-29 record. 
                                    The playoffs saw the Warriors and Rockets meet in the Western Conference Finals for the second year in a row, and it was another competitive series. 
                                    The Warriors won the series in 6 games.   Unfortunately, Kevin Durant went down with a Calf in Game 5 of the series. </p>                    
                                    <p> Over in the East, the Milwaukee Bucks finished with the best record in the league, with a 60-22 record. 
              They were led by the MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, who had a historic season. 
                      The playoffs saw the Bucks make their way to the Eastern Conference finals to face off against the Toronto Raptors, who were looking for their first NBA Finals in franchise history.</p>
                    <p> The finals was a hard-fought series, with the Bucks taking a 2-0 lead in the series. 
                                        But in the end, the Toronto Raptors survive that grinder of a series to make their way to the finals for the first time in franchise history.</p>
                    <p> The Finals was the Raptors vs the Warriors, the Warriors still missing Kevin Durant. The Raptors took this opportunity to take a 3-1 lead in the Finals</p>
                    <p> But in Game 5, it was announced that Kevin Durant would return in Game 5, and the Warriors gained some momentum over the game.
                                          But Durant rushed his return, and in a heartbreaking moment, he tore his Achilles in Game 5, ending his season and possibly his career. The Warriors still won Game 5, but without Durant, they stood no chance in Game 6, as the Raptors won their first championship in franchise history.
                                          Kawhi Leonard was named Finals MVP for his outstanding performance throughout the series, leading both teams in points and rebounds.</p>

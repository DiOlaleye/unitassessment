    <h1> 2014-2015 NBA season</h1>
            <p> This season saw the previous top dogs of the league fall into te shadows, and it was the Golden State Warriors
            who took this chance to prove to the world they were a problem. With Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, And
              Andre Iguodala, they made a statement by finishing the regular season with a league best 67-15 record.
              This was also the year that Steph Curry won his first MVP award, and while there was some controversy over him winning it over James Harden,
              there was no denying that he was the best player in the league that year.</p>
              <p> For the Cleaveland Cavaliers, The Big 3 of LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love dominated the east, finishing second.</p>
                <p> By the time the playoffs rolled around, a lot of hype was around the Cleaveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors. 
                  But, early in the first round, Kevin Love suffered a dislocated shoulder and was ruled out for the rest of the season. 
                  Nevertheless, The Cavaliers made their way to the Finals.</p>
                  <p> Over in the West, the Warriors were making a statement, dominating everyone in the West in style. From making 3s, to Draymond Green's defensive prowess, they were a team to be reckoned with. 
                    They made their way to the finals to face off against the Cavaliers, a team that was missing two of their best players.</p>
                    <p> The Warriors took care of business in 6 games, with Andre Iguondala winning the finals mvp</p>
            <h1> 2015 NBA OFFSEASON</h1>
            <p> The biggest change of the offseason was LaMarcus Aldridge leaving the Portland Trail Blazers to join the San Antonio Spurs.
              Other notable moves include Draymond Green resigning with the Warriors, and Kevin Love resigning with the Cavaliers.</p>

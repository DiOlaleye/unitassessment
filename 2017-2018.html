    <h1> 2017-2018 NBA season</h1>
                        <p> The 2017-2018 season saw the Golden State Warriors continue their reign of terror, but they finished second 
                        in the West Behind the Houston Rockets, who finished with a 65-17 record.
                          The Rockets were led by the MVP James Harden, and his sidekick Chris Paul, who formed a deadly duo that was unstoppable on offense.</p>
                          <p> The playoffs saw the Rockets and Warriors meet in the Western Conference Finals, and it was one of the most 
                            competitive series in recent memory. The Rockets took a 3-2 lead in the series, but the Warriors came back to win the next two games to win the series in 7 games.</p>
                            <p> Over in the East, without Kyrie Irving, Lebron James did all the heavy lifting for his team. He battled the Indiana 
                              Pacers in 7 games, Swept the Toronto Raptors in 4, (earning them the nickname "LeBronto") and beat the Boston Celtics in 7 games to reach the finals.<p>
                              <p> The finals was a rematch of the previous year, but this one was even less competitive, as the Warriors swept the Cavaliers in 4 games. 
                                Kevin Durant was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, and the Warriors cemented their legacy as one of the greatest teams in NBA history.</p>
                                <h1> 2018 NBA OFFSEASON</h1>
                                <p> The biggest move of the 2018 offseason was Kawhi Leonard being traded to the Toronto Raptors, a move that would pay huge dividends in the future.
                                  Other notable moves include DeAndre Jordan being traded to the Dallas Mavericks, and Jimmy Butler being traded to the Philadelphia 76ers.</p>
